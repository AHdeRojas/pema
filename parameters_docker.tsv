#
#
# In this file there are all the parameters that NEED TO BE ASSIGNED every time you need P.E.M.A. to run!
# That does not mean that these parameters that we have here, are the only  parameters of the tools P.E.M.A. uses!
# As you already may know, the combinations are infinite!
# Hence, we encourage you the most to study the manual of each tool and make them as good as possible for your SPECIFIC experiment.
#
# Every line either starts with a "#" or not. All lines that do not start with a "#" are variables that P.E.M.A. asks for.
# You have to set all these parameters according to your data and your experiment.
#
# We chose to have a set of parameters for some tools (mainly for Trimmomatic) as 'by default'.
# That is because in some cases, plenty of time is required in order to have a correct set of those.
# In the link next to each tool, you can find further information about its parameters.
#
#
# YOU NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL WHEN YOU FILL THIS FILE !!
#
#
# From each variable you have to leave EXACTLY ONE (1) TAB and then fill the parameter as you wish.
#
#
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is where the parameters to set are:
#
## Just to test that the parameters are assigned right in our main script:
##  This is just a check that P.E.M.A. is able to read this file. Please continue.
#

#
#
## Give in your each uniq experiment a NAME, so a single output file will be created for each of them.
## ATTENTION! If you do not change the name of the output file, and run a second analysis with the same name, if you have not move the
## first one to another path, then it will be overwritten.

#
## Performs an adaptive quality trim, balancing the benefits of retaining longer reads against the costs of retaining
## bases with errors. The values it takes, can be either 'Y'(Yes) or 'N'(No).
#
#
maxInfo	   Y
#
#
############ for MAXINFO ####################
## Specifies the read length which is likely to allow the
## location of the read within the target sequence to be determined
#
#
targetLength	   200
#
#
## This value, which should be set between 0 and 1, specifies the balance between preserving as much read length as possible vs.
## removal of incorrect bases. A low value of this parameter (<0.2) favours longer reads, while a high value (>0.8) favors read correctness.
#
#
strictness	   0.3
#
#
############ for ILLUMINACLIP ##################
## Specifies the path to a fasta file containing all the adapters, PCR sequences etc.
## The naming of the various sequences within this file determines how they are used.
#
#
adapters    TruSeq2-PE.fa
#
#
## Specifies the maximum mismatch count which will still allow a full match to be performed
#
#
seedMismatches    1
#
#
## Specifies how accurate the match between the two 'adapter ligated' reads must be for PE palindrome read alignment.
#
#
palindromeClipThreshold	   30
#
#
## Specifies how accurate the match between any adapter etc. sequence must be against a read.
#
#
simpleClipThreshold    10
#
#
############ for LEADING  ##########################
## Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality
## Remove low quality bases from the beginning. As long as a base has a value below this threshold the base is removed and the next base will be investigated.
## Its quality: Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
#
#
leading    3
#
#
############ for TRAILING  #############################
## Remove low quality bases from the end. As long as a base has a value below this
## from the 3‟ prime end would be base preceding the just removed base) will be investigated.
## Specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.
#
#
trailing	3
#
#
############  for MINLEN  ################################
## This module removes reads that fall below the specified minimal length.
## The value it takes, specifies the minimum quality required to keep a base.

## PANDAseq has more than one merging algorithms. Here, we set the algorithm used for assembly
## pear --> uses the formula described in the PEAR paper (Zhang 2013), optionally with the probability of a random base (q) provide
## simple_bayesian --> uses the formula described in the original paper (Masella 2012), optionally with an error estimation (ε) provided.
## other options are stich, flash and more that you can fing in the above link
#
#
spadesAlgorithm	simple_bayesian
#
#
## In our command, we also have "-a" that strips the primers after assembly, rather than before.
## And "-B" that allows input sequences to lack a barcode/tag, as well.

#
## The marker gene you have is really important for both the clustering & chimera removal procedure and the
## taxonomy assignment. By default, the pipeline runs for 16S. Substitute with 'COI' if COI is your marker gene
## Write down your gene after character "_" without please erasing it! (e.g. "gene    gene_16S")
#
#
gene	   gene_16S
#
#
## You might want to download the last version of SILVA database and handle it with the primers you have used
## in your experiment in order to get an even better assignment. You can find SILVA 132 already in PEMA/tools
## Hence, by default getting_silva is FALSE. You have to turn it to TRUE in order to do so.
gettingSilva	   FALSE
primerF	   ''
primerR	   ''
#
#
## If your marker gene is 16S, you can choose between 2 different approaches of taxonomy assignment (alignment & phylogenetic based)
## by  default, you get an alignment based taxonomy assignment - set as 'alignment' -  which is based on SILVA and CREST.
## However you can also get a phylogenetic based assignment, by putting 'phylogeny' in this parameter
#
#
taxonomyAssignmentMethod	   alignment
#
#
## If your marker gene is  COI, you can choose between 2 different approaches of clustering. Depending on which of them you choose
## you get either a robust output in a short time (SWARM)  or a non-robust output (CROP) that requires quite much more time. CROP is a bayesian
## algorithm and that is why its output in non-robust. By default, SWARM algorithm runs for the clustering. You have to change in to 'CROP'
## if you want the CROP algorithm to do the clustering step
#
#
clusteringAlgo	algo_SWARM
#
#
# In case of SWARM, the user needs to specify the value of "d" parameter. "d" is the number of mismatches and
# it is the most important parameter of SWARM algorithm. By default "d" equals to 1 (best value for d, according to its authors).
# You are free to set it as you want but a large "d" will possibly give you not so trustful results.
#
#
d    1

#########################   BLAST    #############################
##################################################################
#
## Would you like to get one taxonomy assignment using normal BLAST? It can be either 'Yes' or 'No'.
#
#
blast	N
#
#
#
## Depending on the environment you are working on, you might need to set the path where your Blast Database is located.
#
#
blastDatabase	   /mnt/big/blastdb/nt/nt/nt
#
#
#  If your marker gene is 16S and you wish to use Rhea in order to analyse your returned data
#  then you need to create a tree using these OTUs. If you do wish so, set 'preparingForRhea' as 'Yes'
#
#
forRhea	   N
#
#
## Hence please give us the path where RAxML is located on your cluster
## If you need to make a tree for running Rhea, you will need RAxMl
#
#
raxmlPath	   /usr/bin/raxmlHPC
#
#
## If you do not run P.E.M.A. on Docker and you have R elsewhere, please set the path another way. However, ONLY then
## this parameter needs to change.
#
#
pathForR    /usr/bin/R
#
#
# In case you wish for Beta-diversity from Rhea, then you have to set a categorical variable.
# We should mention here, that P.E.M.A has already created the tree Rhea needs from its first step. Hence, the user now can use Rhea scripts, even out of P.E.M.A
# Hence, you have to set 'categoricalVariable' as 'Y' and then go to the Rhea script for Beta-diversity to set which variable you want as categorical
# as all needed files are made.
#
#
categoricalVariable   	Y
#
#
## Give to PEMA the percentage of similarity over which you want to keep taxonomy as for sure taxa
#
#
percentageOfSimilarity	   91
#
#
## Finally, do you want your raw data to be removed in another file and empty the "rawData" file and all the checkpoints of PEMA to be also in an extra folder
## Swich 'Yes' to 'No' if you wish so. Be very careful when you do that, as you need to remember that if you want to analyze another dataset through P.E.M.A
## you will have to remove the first one manually.
#
#
emptyRawDataFile	   Y
emptyCheckpoints	   Y
