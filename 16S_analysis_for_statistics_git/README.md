This is an example output folder of P.E.M.A. for the Pavloudi *et al.* dataset (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB20211).

In this output folder you can find all the files as they are produced from P.E.M.A. but only for the one of the 
samples of the dataset. 

That is because of the lack of space in Github. 

In addition, all .fasta files have only the 50 sequences, as an example of what you have to expect in your analyses. 

However, the OTU-table (/16S_analysis_for_statistics_git/7.gene_dependent/gene_16S/16S_taxon_assign/16S_otutab.txt) it is 
the one from all samples and it is the one that P.E.M.A. ended up with. 
The same for all the final files (Cumulative, Chao1 etc). This way you can see the final results of the complete analyses, 
but the immediate files of only one sample.

## **ATTENTION!** 
You need to download **all four** .rar folders in order to get the complete output folder as it is! \
