## P.E.M.A.: a Pipeline for Environmental DNA Metabarcoding Analysis for the 16S and COI marker genes

P.E.M.A. is a pipeline for two marker genes, 16S rRNA (microbes) and COI (eukaryotes). As input, P.E.M.A. accepts fastq files as returned by Illumina sequencing platforms. P.E.M.A. processes the reads from each sample and returns an OTU-table with the taxonomies of the organisms found and their abundances in each sample. It also returns statistics and a FASTQC diagram about the quality of the reads for each sample. Finally, in the case of 16S, P.E.M.A. returns alpha and beta diversities, and make correlations between samples. The last step is facilitated by Rhea, a set of R scripts for downstream 16S amplicon analysis of microbial profiles.

In the COI case, two clustering algorithms can be performed by P.E.M.A. (CROP and SWARM), while in the 16S, two approaches for taxonomy assignment are supported: alignment- and phylogenetic-based. For the latter, a reference tree with 1000 taxa was created using SILVA_132_SSURef, EPA-ng and RaxML-ng.



## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
