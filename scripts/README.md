# Scripts

PEMA is a all-code-in-one-file tool, developed in the framework of the [BigDataScript](https://pcingola.github.io/BigDataScript/) programming language.

However, some parts are written in bash scripts or in R scripts, invoked when needed by the main script.

On this folder, you can find all the scripts PEMA needs.

Most of them are written from scratch and some of them (e.g *createContigencyTable.sh* ) are taken from the GitHub repositories of the tools invoked as a way to hanle their outputs.
